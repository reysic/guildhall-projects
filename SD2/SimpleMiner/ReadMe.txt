How to Use
Run SimpleMiner.exe to start the game.

Vertical mouse movement (up and down) pitches the camera (up and down, respectively).

Horizontal mouse movement (left and right) yaws the camera (left and right, respectively).

Holding SPACE BAR flies upward (absolute, e.g. in the +Z direction); Z (or X or C) flies downward 
(absolute, e.g. in the –Z direction).

Holding E flies in the “XY Forward” direction that the camera is facing.

Holding D flies in the reverse direction of E.

Holding S flies in the “XY Left” direction of the camera.

Holding F flies in the “XY Right” direction of the camera.

If the player is holding the SHIFT key, movement speeds are 8x normal.

Pressing the left mouse button digs the currently selected block.

Pressing the right mouse button replaces the currently selected block with the block type chosen in
the HUD.

Cycle through block types in the HUD by pressing the number keys 1 - 6 or scrolling the mouse wheel.

Cycle through camera modes with F5.

Cycle through physics modes with P.

'ESC' key closes the game.

Deep Learning
Asking for help really made a difference in the amount of progress I was able to make on this project
in the last couple weeks. Going forward I will ask for help sooner and work to maintain my morale.
I have to approach my work with my limitations in mind so I can set realistic goals, plan accordingly,
and stay positive.
