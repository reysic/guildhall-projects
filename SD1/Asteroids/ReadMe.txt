Deep Learning
While working on this project I had to resist jumping to the implementation of bonus features before
finishing the implementation of required features. This was likely due to the excitement I felt about
bonus features and some anxiety I had regarding how to implement a couple required features. Ultimately
I did implement all required features and scrap a bonus feature I was working on to ensure the deliverable
was stable and met requirements. Though I regret only getting a single bonus feature in, I believe I 
made the right choice to focus on the required features and then only keep what bonus I could ensure was 
polished.
