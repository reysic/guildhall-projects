Deep Learning
I picked my battles as far as what to implement for this assignment. I tackled tasks I was
confident I could do first and saved ones I was more uncertain about for later. Additionally, if 
I found myself getting bogged down on one particular problem I would step away and work at 
something else. I wasn't able to get all the requirements complete, but I think I was able to 
make what progress I did by managing the order in which I did things.
